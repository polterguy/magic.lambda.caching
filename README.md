# Magic Lambda Caching

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.caching.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.caching)

Cache slots for Magic, more specifically the following slots.

* __[cache.get]__ - Returns a previously cached item, if existing.
* __[cache.set]__ - Adds the specified item to the cache.
* __[cache.evict]__ - Evicts an item from the cache.

## License

Although most of Magic's source code is publicly available, Magic is _not_ Open Source or Free Software.
You have to obtain a valid license key to install it in production, and I normally charge a fee for such a
key. You can [obtain a license key here](https://servergardens.com/buy/).
Notice, 7 days after you put Magic into production, it will stop functioning, unless you have a valid
license for it.
